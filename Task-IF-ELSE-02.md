## Task: Check Whether a Person is Eligible to Vote.

###  Problem Statement:

Write a C program that:

1. Declares an integer variable `age` and assigns it a value.
2. Uses an `if else ` statement to check whether the person is **18 or older**.
3. If the condition is true, print:
   `"You are eligible to vote."`
4. If the condition is false, print:
   `"You are not eligible to vote."`

---

### Example:

If `age = 20`, the output should be:

```
You are eligible to vote.
```
